					<h5 align="left">We may also record or monitor telephone conversations or other communications between you and us, which is another source of how we get data about you.</h5>
					


					<h2 align="left">How do we use that information?</h2>
					<h5 align="left">We use this information to provide you with our services, to improve our services to you, to administer your account and communicate with you.  We also use anonymised information collected from all of our customers for research, profiling and analytical purposes.</h5>

					<h2 align="left">How do we protect your information?</h2>
						<h5 align="left">
							We protect your information by adhering to internationally recognised Information Security best practices and standards.
							We take the security of your data very seriously and use strict procedures to protect it. Whenever we transfer personal data outside of the HNG Area, we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect the data.
							All information you provide to us is stored in HNG data centres which provide secure cloud infrastructure that are designed by Information Security professionals. We adhere to best practices which among many include defence in depth, security by design, least privilege principles and providing both physical and logical access controls.
							We do our best to protect your personal data, but we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access, loss or damage.

					<h2 align="left">How long do we keep your information for?</h2>
						<h5 align="left">
							We keep your information for as long as you have an account on the GoBudget platform. All of your personal data will be removed within six (6) months of you terminating your GoBudget account. After which point we will only retain anonymised data which cannot identify you and is aggregated with anonymised data of other users. We use this aggregated anonymised data for data analysis, profiling and research purposes. We may also keep your email address to ensure that you no longer receive any communications from us and your name, date of birth and latest address for fraud prevention purposes and for the exercise or defence of a legal claim.
